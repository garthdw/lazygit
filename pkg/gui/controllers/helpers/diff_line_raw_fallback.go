// Falling back to another diff when the configured one can't be acted on.
//
// A diff renderer is free to lay a diff out however it likes, and once it has, we can
// only tell which line of which file a row shows if the renderer says so. A renderer
// that doesn't produces a diff that can be read but not staged, edited or copied from,
// so when the user focuses the main view to act on it, we show another diff instead:
// the one git.focusedDiffRenderer renders, if that renderer does say so, and git's own
// otherwise. Browsing keeps the renderer's version; only acting on it needs one we can
// follow.

// MainViewDiffMode says how a side panel should produce the diff it renders into the
// main view: as the user configured it, or — while the main view holds focus and what
// the renderer would produce couldn't be acted on — by the focused diff renderer or as
// git's own.
//
// Every panel that renders a diff into the main view asks, so that a re-render while
// focused — after staging a hunk, say — stays with the diff that can be acted on rather
// than flipping back to the renderer's.

// rows belong only if it states records for them.

// looks at what is there to decide where to put the selection, and a change line
// further down would otherwise be missed.
//
// It is the same diff of the same files, so the view keeps the scroll position it has
// rather than starting from the top: the new rendering lays the changes out its own way
